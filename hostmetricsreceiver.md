from various sources. This is intended to be used when the collector is
deployed as an agent.

## Getting started

The collection interval and the categories of metrics to be scraped can be
configured:

```yaml
hostmetrics:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 1m
  scrapers:
    <scraper1>:
    <scraper2>:
    ...
```

The available scrapers are:
